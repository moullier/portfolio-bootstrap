# Portfolio - Responsive

## Description

This project is a portfolio website, consisting of three HTML files and a CSS file for styling.  It is responsive to the size of the browser viewing the site, so when it is viewed on a smaller screen such as a phone, the information displayed will adjust to show only one column of images.  At this time, the portfolio displays placeholder images and text, and the Contact page is designed but not yet functional.

The primary CSS framework used in designing this site is Bootstrap.  The site is laid out using the Bootstrap grid, which makes it simple to lay out pages using rows and columns, and makes it possible to change the layout on the fly for different browser window sizes.  Bootstrap also contains some pre-formatted components such as navigation bars, and I used some of these as well.

## Credits

In developing this portfolio, I used the Bootstrap Documentation on the grid, found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/layout/grid/.

The code for the sticky footer came from the example at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sticky-footer/.
